Art Piece
The art piece is what is housed in the museum. Many art pieces can be held at the museum. 
Without the art pieces there is no point in visiting the museum so is the main point for the patron.


Museum
There can be many museums but an art piece can only be held at one museum at a time. 
The museums attributes are distinguished by the name and location.


Patron
A patron is distinguished by name. A patron can give one rating to one art piece. There can be many 
patrons who give one rating, or many visits to one museum. Must keep track of rating and person to make sure
the art piece is associated with only one person, but can have multiple ratings from multiple patrons.
